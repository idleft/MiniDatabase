Update Record
--------------
when update a record, we first calculte the updated record size.
1. If its size is equal to the original record, we update the record inplace directly.
2. If the new record size is smaller than orginal record, we update the record at the 
original place, and shift the data records behind to occupy the free space. 
3. If the new record size is bigger than orginal record, we first run reorganize the page.
If the reorganized page has enough free space, we run as 2). If not, we insert the updated
record as a new record, and set the orginal record as tombstone with pointer to the new updated
record.

Delete Record
--------------
In delete record, we set slot->begin to -1 - slot->begin, which indicates this record
is deleted. If the record we want to delete is linked with tombstones, we delete
all the tombstone linked to this record.

Reorganize Page
--------------
Reorganize page go over all record in current page. If meet delete record, shift all data behind to 
occupy the delete record space. If meet tombstone, shrink the tombstone data to only contain 
tombstone marker and pointer to new record.

Scan Iterator
--------------
We first initialize condition variablesby calling initialize API. By calling getNextRecord,
it first reads record, checks given condition, and generates data. To access data,
we go over attribute and compare condition. 

createTable / deleteTable
--------------
We reserved "Tables.tbl" , "column.tbl", "index.tbl" to store catalog information.
If a user wants to create/delete these tables, we just print errors. By creating table, a user can
insert an entry of Table, column, and index to a catalog file. By deleting a table,
a user can delete Table, column, and index record.

getAttributes
--------------
By accessing table ID Map, we can access each table's attributes. By calling readRecord API, 
it is allowed to read a record and format it into column with descriptor.

insertTuple/deleteTuple/deleteTuples
--------------
With given table name, we insert/delete record with attribute description. By deleting tuples,
we destroy file storing records.
